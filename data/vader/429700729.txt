[1:39:19] <joka99999> @Vader Hit the wheels
[1:39:19] <Grettin> Disable the bus instead of killing the driver maybe
[1:39:19] <sonic01tv> Such a botched job

[1:39:30] <FadedRift_> they had tear gas in the old server but taht was aids
[1:39:33] <sasha_the_savage> till number two is fucked
[1:39:34] <Grump__> The bus has to be in a complete stop
[1:39:35] <Prownedacc> @ozro they will die if they try
[1:39:37] <fust0> Cops need RPG Its so unfair
[1:39:38] <cheekycooncheese> eventually the buses will stack up

[1:40:07] <bonjwa2> thats how they work irl
[1:40:08] <foxtrotecho78> I thought police don't do shootouts on no pixel
[1:40:08] <RabidTribble> shotguns in the game in general are so damn tight
[1:40:09] <natiel12> you guys aren't working together
[1:40:09] <Kilagn> tight gachiBASS

[1:40:11] <pettynationbihh> eugene u got into some mess again🤦😂
[1:40:12] <colzzplays> cops need UAVs and Hellstorms
[1:40:12] <shyla287> @absolom3223 They have a swat command, not enough server slots to have swat specific cops
[1:40:14] <OnMyWayBrother> Be funny is someone just came in like "Just need to deposit some money real quick"
[1:40:14] <Lunar_Umbra> ya at that range its should be all over the outer wall

[1:40:28] <MrSym> Real Shotguns have way higher range than you'd expect
[1:40:28] <Zittow> Combat shotguns arent meant to spread, quite realistic

[1:40:33] <Knotten> no, sawed off spreads more, regular shotguns dont
[1:40:33] <TheeBearTV> depends on gun and rounds
[1:40:33] <DopestKush> depends the type of shell
[1:40:34] <absolom3223> depends on the choke settings
[1:40:34] <ScubaLip> depends on the choke
[1:40:34] <Demean1822> Yes it would you morons
[1:40:35] <SlimeBucket_> yeah a bit more but.. thats alot of balls
[1:40:35] <sasha_the_savage> depends what cartridge you use

[1:40:36] <James0000> Jebaited

[1:40:37] <tricker321> yes
[1:40:37] <tdrisc2013> pretty accurate surprisingly
[1:40:37] <Dead_Zattr> some guys here are like "my favorite streamer may win PepeHands "
[1:40:37] <Not395> if cops go down, can they rejoin due to the length of the situation?
[1:40:37] <Canadian369> depends on the shot and choke
[1:40:38] <NOCTU4> if it takes any longer you can rob it again Kappa
[1:40:39] <ajuicyplum1> it depends

[1:40:43] <tricker321> yes it would
[1:40:43] <blackychaan> Depends if it has a barrel chocke
[1:40:43] <JesusSeat> buckshot
[1:40:44] <Gaybriel> You shoot birds out of the sky with them
[1:40:44] <hitokiri_be> They should eventually have to run out of ammo tho...
[1:40:45] <snakepliskiin> depends on the ammo type
[1:40:45] <SoulStonedRob> gun experts for gta LUL
[1:40:45] <ArtosisMitosis> I understand the rule about 4 people hitting the spot, but does that mean someone else can't just randomly help distract the cops?
[1:40:45] <BurtBizzle> not 00 buck
[1:40:45] <leorioss> fucking dundi
[1:40:45] <panda_agent9> thats why their barrels are so long
[1:40:45] <LatteGrande> tight JonCarnage
[1:40:46] <CarlGel> it's pronounced pussa
[1:40:46] <MPKK1NG> depends on what shotgun
[1:40:47] <Bingzwang> Yeah spray more and do less damage
[1:40:47] <SlimeBucket_> cops dont use birdshot
[1:40:47] <J4GGZ> theyll run out of ammo eventually LUL
[1:40:47] <andersfeels> @Vader call someone to come ram them

[1:40:54] <vmads85> How are you getting out of this lol
[1:40:54] <moby1kanobee> i can see him on the roof
[1:40:56] <Sword_Scream> @andersfeels 4 player limit.
[1:40:58] <Prownedacc> @andersfeels they cant, they are already 4
[1:40:58] <MrSym> Is the glass bulletproof?
[1:40:58] <donkey_dressed_asaunicorn> They gonne run out of ammo
[1:41:00] <BrockGrimes> Shotgun spread depends on ammo, barrel type, and length.
[1:41:00] <Hiiggsy> You need a smoke grenade
[1:41:01] <Saint_Patrick88> @andersfeels, max 4 per group
[1:41:01] <Requiem4AD> Dump all the AR ammo and just grab another one from the car.
[1:41:01] <goldmoufshawty> yep
[1:41:02] <Madmoose96> @Vader You have so many people you could call...
[1:41:02] <ozro> @andersfeels thats against RP rules
[1:41:02] <Jayy_Dubs> They'll just get more from the car LUL
[1:41:03] <Bern_92> str8 slugs m8
[1:41:03] <Quinzz> nope unlimited ammo pretty much
[1:41:03] <Trawls421> do AR have an ammo cap
[1:41:03] <WhiTeach> THEYLL JUST SPAWN IN MORE AMMO LULW
[1:41:05] <dirmex> seems like an easy way for someone to score an AR - sneaking up on the roof behind him
[1:41:05] <TheBareOne> no
[1:41:06] <paffkata1914> i think thy have infinite LULW
[1:41:07] <plauntdonk> @andersfeels four man rule
[1:41:07] <uh_ohrog> they can go back to PD to restock
[1:41:08] <CeejeeX> @MrSym yeah
[1:41:08] <thejediforce> Guess they aren’t into FPS games eh?
[1:41:10] <nasirum> @andersfeels legit good idea. hmmm
[1:41:10] <unknown_paradox> They can't get extra help chat
[1:41:10] <Prmitive> I would say the 3 big variables are distance, choke and type of load
[1:41:14] <ArtosisMitosis> What if the fifth isn't part of your "group"?
[1:41:15] <izzi030> zzzzzzzzzzZzzzzzzzzzzz
[1:41:15] <pardux> LUL they can just go one by one and restock the ammo
[1:41:16] <olis_> they have unlimited ammo LUL LUL
[1:41:16] <SilentHRogue> can you shoot from prone?
[1:41:17] <goldmoufshawty> its against the rules to get more ammo so we'll see @Vader
[1:41:18] <ttvweazel> @andersfeels why do people keep typing this dumb idea. They already have a group of 4
[1:41:18] <mrchronicnosebleeds> they keep like 800 bullets toonyKEK
[1:41:18] <soKaxyz> i left 20 minutes ago for dinner and you guys are still here
[1:41:19] <Bingzwang> Can you just shoot the cars alot
[1:41:19] <UnkleKuzin> Can u explain the doors. Are they backwards from what we are seeing?
[1:41:19] <ScubaLip> any luck with the cards?
[1:41:19] <HonorNecris> Do they have a plan?
[1:41:20] <albiwishnom> Choke would close the shot but I’d say most shotguns at that range would probably spread a bit more
[1:41:20] <Riseyy> so is dab gonna perma after his last days are complete, or just leave
[1:41:20] <GodFatherr> He probably went down got extra ammo and went back up
[1:41:21] <ununseptium117> @Trawls421 the AR ammo is heavy af
[1:41:23] <starcell1983> unlimitedpower cheat activated lol

[1:41:28] <Fishnet83> 26 crims vs 6 cop max PogU
[1:41:28] <cheese_is_yum> for real, just dont talk lol
[1:41:28] <impolitejerk_> that is a stupid rule
[1:41:29] <MPKK1NG> do a raid then with 8 people
[1:41:29] <darrenmau5> On the DL though? JK
[1:41:30] <ArtosisMitosis> So, what would happen if someone just opted to help on their own?
[1:41:30] <MPKK1NG> :)
[1:41:31] <killervictor83_> But they have like 1000 ammo
[1:41:32] <RezGamingg> @MomusTheGreat whisper me bro
